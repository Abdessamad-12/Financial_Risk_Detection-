Voltalia (Euronext Paris, code ISIN : FR0011995588), an international player in renewab le 
energies, publishes its first quarter 2023 turnover.  
“ The quarter was marked by a sustained increase in energy sales. It was a record first quarter thanks to 
commissioning in recent months and better wind conditions, both in Brazil and in France. In Services, growth 
was driven by internal services, reflecting the ramp-up of the power plant projects to be commissioned this year. 
On the strength of this first quarter, we reaffirm our 2023 EBITDA target and our 2027 ambitions ”, commented 
Sébastien Clerc, CEO of Voltalia.

Q1 2023 turnover from Energy Sales reached €62.9 million, up +46% (+41% at constant exchange rates) 
compared to Q1 2022. 
 
Quarterly production amounted to 0.9 TWh compared to 0.7 TWh in 2022, reflecting the improvement in wind 
and solar resources and the increase in installed capacity in operation to 1 637 MW (+41%) at the end of March 
2023.

PRESS RELEASE

Analysis by country 
• 
In Brazil, production increased by +45% to 794 MWh, benefiting in particular from the full production of 
the SSM1-2 solar power plants (320 MW), which was commissioned progressively in 2022, and from 
better wind conditions at the wind power plants; 
• 
In France, production increased by +4%, benefiting from the commissioning in 2022 of Carrières de 
Plaines (8.9 MW) and the acquisition of Cap Sud by Helexia in March 2022 (renamed Helexia Agri); 
• 
In other countries, Voltalia benefits from the growth of Helexia, as well as the commissioning of South 
Farm in the United Kingdom (49.9 MW) and Stavria in Greece (12 MW). 
 
SERVICES 
Q1 2023 turnover from Services (internal and external) reached €101.9 million, up +58% (+55% at constant 
exchange rates) compared to Q1 2022.  
The Development, Construction and Equipment Procurement segment increased by +61% to €92.9 million, 
thanks to a five-fold increase in internal activity over the period, reflecting the record capacity under construction 
for own account, which amounted to 980 MW at the end of March 2023. External turnover from these segments 
on behalf of third-party customers decreased by 38% to €30.2 million. Although more than 580 MW are currently 
under construction for third party customers (x2.5 vs Q1 2022), few significant milestones have yet been reached 
during the period, as Voltalia recognizes construction turnover as projects progress.  
The Operation-Maintenance segment increased by +31% to €9.0 million (+31% at constant exchange rates) 
thanks to the strong momentum of new third-party contracts won in Europe and Brazil. 
Eliminations of turnover in Q1 2023 amounted to €65.9 million (x5 at current and constant exchange rates), 
reflecting the strong increase in internal services for plants under construction, the vast majority of which are 
due to be commissioned before the end of 2023, and in operation. 
 
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTION) 
 
Mandate with IFC for the financing of the Dwangwa solar power plant in Malawi 6 
 
Voltalia has signed a mandate with IFC (International Finance Corporation), the private sector arm of the World 
Bank Group, to finance the Dwangwa project in Malawi (55 MW of solar power and 10 MW of battery storage). 
The electricity will be sold under a 20-year contract with Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi Ltd, the state-
owned electricity transmission and distribution company. 
 
The Sud Vannier wind farm produces its first kilowatt hours7  
 
Voltalia is continuing to establish itself in the Grand Est region with the commissioning of its Sud Vannier wind 
farm. With a capacity of 23.6 MW, the project is the third wind farm in the northeast quarter of France after those 
of Sarry (23.1 MW) and Molinons (10 MW). The production is sold to Leroy Merlin under a 23-year contract, the 
first corporate PPA8 for wind power in France.

PRESS RELEASE 
April 26, 2023 
Appeal of a preliminary decision to suspend permits for the Canudos project in Brazil9  
 
The preliminary judicial decision relates to the permits for the Canudos wind farms, located in the state of Bahia, 
and currently under construction with a total capacity of 99.4 MW. According to the decision, the environmental 
agency has implemented a procedure that was not applicable. Indeed, the project is located in an area populated 
by the aras de lear, a brazilian parrot. A complementary environmental study is requested. 
 
2023 OBJECTIVES CONFIRMED 
Voltalia recalls that its target of 2.6 GW of capacity in operation and under construction, which the Company 
had planned to reach by the end of 2023, was reached by the end of 202210, one year ahead of schedule.  
Voltalia reiterates its normalised EBITDA11 target for 2023, which is expected to be in the range of €275 to 
€300 million. 
 
2027 AMBITIONS REAFFIRMED 
Last October, Voltalia defined a new growth plan for 2027, including the following ambitions: 
• 
Owned operating and construction capacity: over 5 GW; 
• 
Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 GW; 
• 
Normalised EBITDA12: around €475 million; 
• 
CO2-equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes.
