Christian Guillemot, AMA co-founder and CEO: “2022 was marked by a number of challenges linked to managing 
changes in a post-covid period and the deterioration in the economic and geopolitical environment. Faced with 
difficulties predicting the development of our market, we recorded accounting impairments which affected our earnings. 
Nevertheless, our cash management was improved through the cost reduction measures rolled out, effective from the 
second half of 2022. This was accomplished while maintaining an international commercial strategy and continuing to 
improve our software solutions. For instance, we further enhanced our XpertEye solution with a number of additional 
features, while making it simpler to use thanks to the On & Live concept. We also improved our commercial offering 
through initiatives aimed at facilitating the widespread adoption of different uses of our solutions. These key steps 
forward enabled us to successfully renew virtually all of the projects started in 2020 with our most significant clients 
and to further expand our client base. In view of these developments, combined with the continued improvement in the 
quality and price of the hardware associated with our solutions, orders are expected to pick up again in 2023”.

2022 earnings 
AMA recorded revenues of €4.3m in 2022, compared with €6.6m in 2021, down 34.8% at current exchange rates. 
This trend continues to reflect the wait-and-see approach adopted by clients faced with an unfavorable economic 
environment. 
The percentage of revenues generated by Software, AMA’s core business with its XpertEye platform, increased by 
+5% (at current exchange rates) compared with 2021, climbing to 63% of revenues for the year (versus 37% in 2021), 
for a total of €2.6m. However, the percentage of Hardware revenues contracted by 63% to represent 27% of 2022 
revenues, compared with 46% the previous year, for a total of €1.1m. Hardware comprises a range of equipment 
(connected glasses, external video sources, etc.) supplied by third parties that complement the use of XpertEye. 
In 2022, AMA further strengthened its client base, with 497 clients, up from 490 in 2021. AMA consolidated its 
positions with its existing clients, primarily major groups (e.g. Merck, Alstom, Air Liquide, Boehringer, KPMG), by 
renewing the vast majority of the significant contracts signed in 2020, but with lower average basket values, linked in 
particular to the non-renewal of Hardware. The churn rate remained limited to 7.9% of 2021 revenues and 
corresponded primarily to clients representing €4.2k of revenues on average over the year. In 2022, AMA welcomed 
119 new clients on board. 
Adjusted EBITDA shows a loss of €9.0m, compared with a €6.1m loss in 2021. The global cost reduction plan launched 
in June 2022 had positive impacts from the second half of 2022, although these were not particularly visible in terms 
of the annual comparison between 2022 and 2021. For instance, in 2022, staff costs increased by €0.5m (+4.7%) 
compared with 2021, but decreased by -32% between the first half and second half of 2022. The total headcount at 
end-2022 was 87 people, compared with 184 at the end of 2021. The operating loss was reduced by €1.4m during 
the second half of the year compared with the first half of 2022. 
The following profit and loss items were impacted by non-recurring expenses and impairments. In accordance with 
IAS 36 and IAS 38, faced with the slowdown in the assisted reality market, which was confirmed in 2022, intangible 
assets were depreciated by €7.4m. Non-current expenses also include €1m linked to the reduction in the workforce 
(PSE employment protection plan). Factoring in these elements, AMA recorded an operating loss of -€20.8m for 2022. 
From the second half of 2022, AMA recognized all of its R&D expenditure as expenses. Following this pivotal year, 
AMA is positioned to set off again with new foundations in place for 2023. 
Financial structure at end-2022 
AMA had €8.6m of cash at end-2022. In view of the cost reduction measures rolled out, AMA is in a position to cover 
its cash requirements in 2023. AMA also has €16m of unused credit lines. 
2023 first-quarter revenues and launch of the new commercial offering 
For the first quarter of 2023, AMA is reporting unaudited consolidated revenues of €0.8m at constant exchange rates 
(-24% versus Q1 2022). The majority of the new commercial offers were rolled out in March and therefore did not 
impact the first quarter. However, the amounts of software orders are still trending up, reflecting the positive response 
to the new Enterprise Model commercial offer, designed to facilitate the XpertEye solution’s larger-scale deployment 
in major groups. 
Outlook for 2023 
AMA aims to continue moving forward with its commercial development strategy, while maintaining a streamlined cost 
structure. 
To contribute to the emergence of assisted reality solutions for frontline workers and provide businesses, major groups 
and institutions with solutions to meet the challenges linked to productivity, savings and managing climate impacts, 
AMA: 
• 
is further strengthening its key partnerships with organizations such as Orange Business, which are 
increasingly contributing to the distribution and use of XpertEye solutions, as well as Soti, Akila, Thalos, inUSe 
and Rofim for software integration, and Cellnex, HubOne, Dust or Inmarsat for network connectivity aspects. 
• 
is offering new commercial initiatives at the start of 2023, including free trial offers and the Enterprise Model, 
with a view to accelerating XpertEye’s distribution and use through packages of licenses and volume-based 
offers.

• 
Accentuates specific actions and concrete data information enabling its customers to use XpertEye as a real 
accelerator of their digital and ecological transition. For example, AMA provides its customers with 
personalized assessments and reports on the CO2 emissions avoided by using XpertEye, for instance by 
reducing their travel.  
• 
is incorporating AI to increase its solution’s impacts by enabling its clients for instance to expands the skills 
available in the field by facilitating, thanks to AI, access to the company’s knowledge bases. 
In view of these developments, combined with the continued improvement in the quality and price of the hardware 
associated with XpertEye solutions, orders are expected to pick up again in 2023.
