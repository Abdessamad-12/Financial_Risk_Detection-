Pharmaceutical Synthesis 
 
The Pharmaceutical Synthesis business generated sales of €43.5 million, a 39.0% increase compared to 2022 
(a 38.5% increase at a constant exchange rate). Rising net sales can be attributed primarily to  a higher 
demand in R&D and in most production sites as well as the price increase policy initiated in 2022 to cope with 
the rising costs of raw materials, energy and supplies.  
 
 
Fine Specialty Chemicals 
 
Net sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled €22.7 million, a 14.2% increase compared to 2022 (a 12.1% 
increase at a constant exchange rate). Business levels are still high in the first months of the year, with a very 
strong demand for Electronics and Fine Chemicals. A slight slowdown can be observed in the Lubricants 
business. The industrialization of new products is still at a good level across all sites. 
 
 
 
Outlook 
 
In the context of the ongoing dispute with Mithra, PCAS continues to study a temporary reduction in activity in 
2023 on the production site where certain workshops are dedicated to the production of Estetrol. At this stage, 
it is still not possible to precisely assess the consequences of this dispute on future business and results. 
 
As stated in the press release of March 30, 2023, as a consequence, the return to positive results announced 
for 2023 is delayed.  
 
PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for 
the financing of its activities and its development.
