FIRST QUARTER 2023 REVENUE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Group revenue: €5,077 million 
Up 2% as reported and up 1% on a comparable basis  
 
 
 
“Kering’s performance in the first quarter remained mixed, as we had anticipated. As we work to augment the 
desirability of our brands and raise their profile in key markets, we are encouraged by the gradual improvement in 
activity month after month during the period. A host of initiatives undertaken by all our Houses to enhance their 
appeal and exclusivity lays the foundations for sustained, profitable growth.” 
François-Henri Pinault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
 
 
 
− 
In the first quarter of 2023, the Group’s revenue grew by 2% as reported and by 1% on a comparable 
basis, with trends improving throughout the period.  
o 
Revenue in the directly operated store network, including e-commerce, rose by 4% on a 
comparable basis, with all Group Houses contributing to the growth. The increase was driven by 
good momentum in Western Europe and Japan. Revenue was down in North America but 
resumed growth in Asia-Pacific due to the gradual recovery of the Chinese market. 
o 
Wholesale and other revenue was down 10% on a comparable basis, as the Group’s Houses 
continue to reduce the share of wholesale in their distribution.
