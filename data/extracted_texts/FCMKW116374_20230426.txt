Logistic’s solutions.  
The relevance of Cnova’s platform model is confirmed by an all-time high marketplace share and record high

goods, but preserving and still benefiting from strengthened relationships with top 
international brands

Business Highlights 
 
A record high marketplace GMV share with accelerated positive trends compared to pre-
pandemic level: 
• 
Marketplace reached all-time highest marketplace share in Q1 at 57% for the 1st quarter 
2023 (+9pts vs. 22, +21pts vs. 19), mainly driven by home categories and new strategic 
partnerships, confirming the mix evolution towards more marketplace revenues. During 
the 1st quarter 2023, marketplace GMV was nearly stable (-4% vs. 22), in a context of 
strong inflation headwinds and macro-economic uncertainties

New marketplace strategic partnerships were formed, including with a childcare 
specialist and a leading company specialized in consumer goods

A new dedicated team of 20 collaborators was assembled to accelerate the recruitment 
and sales of the new Top sellers of the French, European and other international markets 
 
Cnova continues the rationalization of its direct sales assortment with improving profitability 
and cash profile, supporting the overall Gross Margin increase. 
 
This resilient performance for both direct sales and marketplace has been supported by 
disruptive offers launched this quarter, such as the new payment installment solution provided 
by Floa Bank for Apple products (including the possibility to trade an old device), and a strong 
and increasing customer satisfaction measured by the NPS at 55 (+11pts vs. 19, steady vs. 22). 
 
Expansion of marketplace SKUs eligible to express delivery is a key driver of growth and 
customer satisfaction. It is also determinant to support the product mix re-orientation towards 
the marketplace: 
• 
Cdiscount Express Seller, launched in 2019 for sellers able to offer express delivery to 
CDAV customers, reached a 15.4% marketplace GMV share for the 1st quarter 2023 
(+4.1pts vs. 22) 
• 
Fulfilment by Cdiscount marketplace GMV share stands at 34.9% for the 1st quarter 2023. 
A consequent effort is made to provide always more quality by recruiting top sellers with 
now a wider assortment than traditional retail sales 
 
B2C Services showed a record performance: 
• 
B2C Services GMV, excluding Energy, amounted to €36m in the 1st quarter 2023, reaching 
again a solid growth (+37% vs. 22, x2.6 vs. 19)

• 
Advertising services revenues reached €17m for Q1 (+9% vs. 22), with growing GMV take 
rate standing at 3.5% (+0.9pt vs. 22) 
o Advertising services growth is mainly supported by Retail Media, which accounts 
for €13m of revenues for Q1 (+19% vs. 22) and allows both sellers and suppliers 
to reinforce their visibility and increase their sales 
o Growth is also driven by a dynamic offer expansion, with the creation of new 
formats, such as the launch of “premium” shops for sellers (12 signed sellers) 
 
Octopia’s B2B revenues know a strong commercial dynamic, driven by its turnkey 
marketplace solution for EMEA retailers and e-merchants: 
• 
Successful launches of 2 marketplaces (Bébéboutik and an international retailer) 
• 
Outperformed revenues on Fulfilment-as-a-Service, with an increase in shipped parcels 
(+38% vs. 22) and the development of the activity in Spain

of the number of sellers deployed  
• 
Successful launch of the drop-shipping offer for sellers, with 38 active sellers at end of the 
quarter on Products-as-a-Service 
 
C-Logistics is developing its B2B activities through the successful launch of its third party-
logistic solution for a European sportswear company, a service quality above customers’ 
expectations and knows a strong ramp-up with an increase in the number of shipped parcels for 
external clients (x3 vs. 22), representing an increase of 2.2pts in C-Logistics total number of 
shipped parcels. New strategic transportation flows have been implemented, enabling products 
delivery in Europe, with Chronopost for Express Delivery and BPost for Standard Delivery. 
C-Logistics is also optimizing its costs and adapting its structure with the rationalization of 
transportation offers and the increase in warehouses productivity.  
C-Logistics ESG approach has been pursued with significant efforts to decrease its energy 
consumption (-21% vs. 22). 
 
Environmental, social and societal stakes such as human capital, climate, business ethics 
and societal commitment are at the heart of Cnova’s B2B and B2C strategic development: 
• 
Cnova is committed to promoting a more responsible consumption through its direct 
sales and marketplace product offer. Actions carried out by Cdiscount and Octopia aiming 
to develop “more sustainable products” (e.g., increasing the visibility of these products and 
guaranteeing affordable prices) enable a continuous acceleration of this offer. “More 
sustainable products” account for 15.2% of Cdiscount’s Product GMV at 1Q (+3.8pts vs. 
22)

protection and signed the new version of the Product Safety Pledge at the European 
Consumer Summit organized by the European Commission
