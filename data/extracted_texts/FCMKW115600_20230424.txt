Groupement Les Mousquetaires, TERACT and Casino Group 
are in exclusive discussions to further develop their industrial 
and purchasing partnerships and optimise their respective 
networks 
 
 
Paris, 24 April 2023 
 
 
As part of the project to create a new major French player in responsible and sustainable 
retail activities that enhance farmers’ revenue as announced on 9 March 2023 by Casino 
Group and TERACT, Groupement Les Mousquetaires, Casino Group and TERACT 
announce that they are in exclusive discussions to further develop the existing strategic 
cooperation between Groupement Les Mousquetaires and Casino Group. 
Groupement Les Mousquetaires and Casino Group are considering to extend their 
alliances by two years until 2028 (Auxo Achats Alimentaires, Auxo Achats Non Alimentaires 
and Auxo Achats Non Marchands) and to extend their agreements to the new entity to 
be formed between Casino Group and TERACT, which would be controlled by Casino 
Group. 
It is also considered to build new partnerships between the new entity and Groupement 
Les Mousquetaires:  
- 
a purchasing alliance in Private Label (Marque Distributeur) food products, 
- 
a supply from Groupement Les Mousquetaires’ Seafood (Marée) and Butchery 
(Boucherie) channels, relying on AgroMousquetaires’s recognized know-how, 
- 
an access for Groupement Les Mousquetaires to the recognised expertise in fresh 
produce channels (filières) of TERACT Ferme France’s, a newly created entity in 
charge of the supply of agricultural and local products to the entity to be 
incorporated. 
In addition, the new entity could transfer to Groupement Les Mousquetaires, over several 
years and at market value, a number of points of sale from the Casino France perimeter 
representing a minimum of €1.1 bn of turnover including VAT. While maintaining the overall 
volume negotiated by the Purchasing alliances and preserving employment, these 
transfers would allow to accelerate the geographical refocusing of Casino labels on the 
target and priority regions for its new project and would allow Intermarché to expand its 
national network. 
Groupement Les Mousquetaires could also become a minority shareholder in the new 
entity. In this context, InVivo and Groupement Les Mousquetaires are considering an 
investment of €300m in the new entity. In accordance with the press release of 9 March 
2023, Casino and TERACT’s shareholders of reference have started discussions with other 
potential investors to complete its fundraising, confirming the objective to raise a total of

€500m of additional equity to provide the new entity with the appropriate financial 
resources to implement its ambitious strategic plan. 
Depending on their progress, these discussions will be submitted for consultation to the 
employee representative bodies, the competent regulatory authorities and the respective 
governance of Casino Group, Groupement Les Mousquetaires, TERACT and InVivo. 
As indicated in the press release of 9 March 2023, this project remains conditional on the 
conclusion of a binding agreement between the parties, which could intervene before 
the end of the second quarter of 2023 and of which the market will be kept informed. 
 
Pursuant to the European Commission's Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1055 of 29 June 2016, relating to the technical 
procedures for the publication and deferral of inside information, this press release was communicated to Casino's 
authorized distributor for release on 24 April 2023 at 07:45 CET.
