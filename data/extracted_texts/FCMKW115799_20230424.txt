The Lumibird Group’s consolidated revenues came to €40.9m at March 31, 2023, up 8% (9% at
constant exchange rates).
By Market Segment
The Photonics division grew by 6% (+7% at constant exchange rate) and the 2023 target is expected
to be achieved. Due to the move to the new site in Villejust, Paris, the manufacturing site production
levels were reduced by one-third in the first quarter. This impacted Industrial and Scientific Revenue
which was 5.4m, 31% lower than the comparative period. The Paris plant is now fully operational
and will support the strong demand for the year 2023. Compared to Q1 2021, Lidar was up 6%
(€5.2m) and the Defense and Space segment grew 70% to 7.8m, including the laser rangefinder
business developed in Sweden since May 2022 (€2.8m).
The Medical division grew by 9% to €22.5m. The division’s sales are split between Diagnostic (24%)
and Treatment (76%). The first quarter was very active in terms of sales and marketing activities
for both segments (worldwide products launches, keys congress in Asia and South America) and the
new Slovenian site is now fully operational and will support the strong demand for the year 2023.
The Laser product range was fueled by the launch of the new Neo family of products while the
adoption of the Ultrasound product range continues to grow in new markets as Lumibird Medical
receives new approvals.
1 Lumibird Photonics Sweden is included in the scope of consolidation from 2021. The revenue developed by this
subsidiary since the integration of the Saab Group's defence laser rangefinder activities in May 2022 is included in
organic revenue. It amounted to €5.7m in 2022. There is no scope effect in Q1 2023.

Unaudited data
The Photonics Division recorded strong growth in Europe (+20%). This was led by France.
The Medical Division also recorded strong growth in Europe (+13%). This was led by Central Europe
and the UK. In Asia Pacific we saw strong performance by Japan and Australia.
Outlook
LUMIBIRD continues to have a strong order book – for Photonics and Medical – thanks to a portfolio
of strong technological value-added products and a global commercial footprint.
Within the Group's current scope, the objectives remain an organic revenue growth of 8-10% and
an EBITDA margin in the range of 20% to 25%. The Group continues to be active on potential
acquisition opportunities. If they were to be completed in 2023, the Group could reach an annual
turnover (including the contribution of the acquired businesses over 12 months) of up to EUR 250
million. Some of these potential acquisitions may be dilutive on EBITDA, which would bring down to
18-23% the Group’s FY EBITDA margin (including the contribution of acquired businesses over 12
months) in the first year of acquisition.
