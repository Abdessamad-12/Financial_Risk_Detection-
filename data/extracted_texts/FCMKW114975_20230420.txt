First quarter revenue  
Reminder relative to the impacts of the disposal of Russian automotive activities on financial 
statements: as a result of the agreements to sell 100% of Renault Group's shares in Renault Russia 
to the City of Moscow and its 67.69% stake in AVTOVAZ to NAMI (the central institute for research 
and development of automobiles and engines) announced on May 16th, 2022, the Russian activities 
were deconsolidated in Renault Group's financial statements and treated as discontinued 
operations under IFRS 5 with retroactive effect from January 1st, 2022.  
The revenue for 2023 Q1 therefore no longer includes the Russian industrial activities. Group revenue 
for 2022 Q1 has been adjusted in line with this new scope of activity (impacts: AVTOVAZ -€527 million 
and Renault Russia -€367 million).   
 
Group revenue for 2023 Q1 amounted to €11.5 billion, up 29.9% compared to 2022 Q1.  
At constant scope and exchange rates6, Group revenue was up 33.5%. 
Automotive revenue reached €10.5 billion, up 29.7% compared to 2022 Q1. This strong improvement 
is mainly explained by the following: 
• 
A strong volume effect of +18.6 points, essentially due to the increase in production compared 
to 2022 Q1, thanks to the commercial success of new vehicles coupled with an improved 
availability of EC components. This volume effect is higher than the growth in registrations 
due to a lower destocking of the independent dealer network in 2023 Q1 compared to 2022 Q1, 
when EC crisis was at peak. 
 
• 
A robust price effect of +9.4 points, reflecting the continuation of the commercial policy 
focused on value, price increases to offset cost and currency inflation, and an optimization 
of commercial discounts.  
• 
An increasing product mix effect of +5.2 points mainly resulting from Megane E-TECH Electric 
and Austral which average revenue per unit is largely higher than Renault Group’s average. 
• 
A geographic mix of +2.7 points benefiting from the strong performance of European sales.  
 
6 In order to analyze the change in consolidated revenue at constant scope and exchange rates, Renault Group recalculates revenue for the current financial 
year by (applying the average exchange rates of the previous period and excluding significant changes in scope during the period   
 
 
4 
 
• 
A positive impact of sales to partners of +0.9 points, mainly supported by a dynamic LCV 
market driving sales to Nissan, Renault Trucks and Mercedes-Benz as well as from the start 
of production of the ASX for Mitsubishi Motors.  
These positive effects more than offset: 
• 
A forex impact of -2.6 points, mainly related to the Argentinian Peso. 
• 
An "Other" effect of -4.5 points, related to a decrease in the contribution of sales from the 
Renault Retail Group network following the disposals of branches, partially offset by the 
performance in the aftersales activity. 
Mobility Services contributed €9 million to 2023 Q1 revenue compared to €8 million in 2022 Q1.  
Mobilize Financial Services (formerly RCI Bank and Services) posted revenue of €974 million in  
2023 Q1, up 32.2% compared to 2022 Q1 due to higher interest rates and to the increase of new 
contracts coupled with higher average amount financed.   
Average performing assets (€49.4 billion) increased by 13% compared to 2022 Q1. This is supported 
by vehicle restocking in the dealerships and by a 17.4% increase in new financing for the retail 
business.  
 
At March 31, 2023, total inventories (including the independent network) represented 580,000 
vehicles: 
• The Group is still facing logistics issues explaining the growth of Group inventories at 273,000 
vehicles.  
• The independent dealer inventories stood at 307,000 units in line with the orderbook which 
remains at record levels in absolute value.
