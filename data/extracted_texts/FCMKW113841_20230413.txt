In the first quarter of 2023, the Safe Group's revenue was €1505k, showing growth of +6% compared 
with the first quarter of 2022.  
 
Safe Orthopaedics sales were stable at €915k, compared with €928k the previous year.  
 
Direct sales amounted to €594k thanks to strong commercial growth in France (+45%) and the UK 
(+25%). Indirect sales contracted by 6% to €321k in the first quarter, explained by the still limited post-
covid investments by distributors.  
 
Sales of new technologies amounted to €73K in Q1. After their Franco-German evaluation, Sycamore 
and Hickory are in full commercial roll-out and are awaiting their approvals in the United States as well 
as their availability on indirect markets. SORA is still being evaluated in France and should be deployed 
in a German center in the second quarter. 
 
Safe Medical's business grew by 20% to €590k compared with the first quarter of 2022. This growth is 
mainly generated by historical customers, who are repositioning Safe Medical as a strategic supplier.

PRESS RELEASE 
 
"First-quarter sales amounted to €1.5 million, up thanks to the strong performance of Safe 
Orthopaedics in France and the United Kingdom and the renewed confidence of Safe Medical's long-
standing customers. The new technologies and the partnership with Wenzel should enable us to boost 
our commercial execution in Germany and the United States, the largest European and global markets 
respectively," commented Pierre Dumouchel, Chairman and CEO and co-founder of Safe Orthopaedics. 
"Thanks to the new financing agreement announced in March, we have initiated structural changes 
that should enable us to reduce operating expenses and working capital requirements while 
maintaining the investments necessary for the commercial growth of our Safe technologies and 
services. 
 
 
Cash position 
 
Following a significant refinancing of Safe SA in the amount of nearly €30 million last March, paid in 
monthly instalments of €600 thousand for the first four instalments and €500 thousand for the 
following ones, the Group's unaudited cash position at March 31, 2023 amounted to €268k thousand.  
 
It is reminded that the press release published on March 14, 2023 underlines the risks inherent to this 
type of financing, which is potentially highly dilutive.
