Lille (France); Cambridge (Massachusetts, United States); Zurich (Switzerland); April 13, 2023 - GENFIT (Nasdaq and 
Euronext: GNFT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with severe chronic 
liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs, today announced annual financial results for the year ended 
December 31, 2022. A summary of the consolidated financial statements is included further below. 
 
Pascal Prigent, CEO of GENFIT, commented:  
“2022 was a transformative year for GENFIT. It was marked by both the fast progression of our lead program and the expansion of 
our pipeline in rare and severe liver diseases, notably with the acquisition of Versantis AG. We are now approaching an inflection 
point: this quarter we expect to report data from our pivotal Phase 3 study in PBC. There is still an important unmet medical need 
in this market, and we are very encouraged by the previous Phase 2 data reported as part of this program. We believe elafibranor 
has significant potential, and we hope it will be demonstrated soon. Beyond this exciting milestone, we have built a rich pipeline, that 
now includes 3 additional phase 2-stage programs and 2 preclinical-stage programs. This pipeline, combined with a robust cash 
position and the near-term commercial perspectives for elafibranor, provide us with a unique opportunity to drive transformative 
value in 2023.” 
 
I. 
2022 Key Highlights

Pipeline progress 
– 
Acquisition of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Versantis 
In September 2022, GENFIT acquired clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Versantis based in Zurich (Switzerland), 
significantly expanding its pipeline. This acquisition has reinforced GENFIT’s position as a leader in  ACLF and other severe liver 
diseases. Given the unmet need related to target diseases, it is expected that the programs qualify for some of the expedited 
regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.  
 
 
Two Pipeline Days were organized in October 2022 in Paris and New York, to present these programs in detail. A replay of these 
events is available here: https://ir.genfit.com/events/event-details/genfit-pipeline-day-nyc 
 
– 
Assessment of Nitazoxanide (NTZ) in hepatic and renal impaired patients     
Two Phase 1 studies were conducted, aimed at providing insight into NTZ pharmacokinetics and safety in the setting of hepatic 
impairment or renal impairment, in order to prepare for the launch of a Phase 2 study in ACLF in the second half of 2023.  
 
– 
Orphan Drug Designation granted to GNS561 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma 
In September 2022 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation to GNS561 
(ezurpimtrostat), a novel clinical-stage autophagy/PPT1 inhibitor, for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).  
 
– 
Compelling results for NIS2+TM in NASH  
In October 2022, GENFIT announced the development of NIS2+TM, a next-generation technology for the diagnosis of at-risk 
NASH, and the presentation of results on NIS2TM+’s clinical performance in three poster presentations at The Liver Meeting® 
2022 organized by the AASLD2. The NIMBLE initiative of the FNIH3 highlighted in 2021 the strong and unique performance of 
NIS4® technology in identifying patients with at-risk NASH. 
 
II. 
 2023 Anticipated Milestones  
 
Topline Phase 3 data for elafibranor in PBC: towards the end of 2Q23  
 
Topline results for the ELATIVE®  study are now imminent and expected to be announced towards the end of the second quarter 
of 2023.  
 
Phase 2 results showed a statistically significant improvement on both the primary and composite biochemical evaluation criteria, 
the latter now being the primary endpoint of the pivotal Phase 3 trial to support accelerated approval. In addition, the results 
showed a positive trend on the improvement of pruritus, while preserving a favorable safety and tolerability profile. These

positive conclusions were published in the Journal of Hepatology in 2021.4 Safety data derived from more than 1,000 patients in 
the biopsy-based Phase 3 RESOLVE-IT® trial of elafibranor in NASH also supported further development in PBC.  
 
Under the agreement with Ipsen, GENFIT is eligible to receive regulatory, commercial, and sales-based milestone payments up 
to €360 million, with a potential first significant milestone payment as early as 2023 and an additional potential milestone 
payment in 2024, if ELATIVE® is successful. In addition, GENFIT is eligible for double-digit royalties of up to 20%.  In the case 
of a positive trial outcome, the well-established global commercial footprint of Ipsen will be an important driver of commercial 
success. By 2024, if approved, elafibranor could potentially become a new therapeutic option for PBC patients not responding 
to UDCA5, and become the first alternative to currently approved second line treatment in a market estimated at $1.5bn in the 
coming years, and $3.1 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.6  
 
Additional clinical programs underway 
 
– 
1st patient screening in a Phase 2 study evaluating VS-01 in ACLF: 2Q23 
An international Phase 2, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center, proof of concept study will assess the efficacy, safety 
and tolerability of VS-01 in addition to standard of care (SOC), compared to SOC alone, in approximately 60 adult patients with 
ACLF grades 1 and 2 and who also have ascites. A Phase 1 trial highlighted the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VS-01 
and provided encouraging preliminary efficacy results, with >80% of treated patients improving or stabilizing their disease (Child-
Pugh Score assessment). It is anticipated that the first patient will be screened in this trial in the second quarter of 2023. Given 
the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for VS-01, it is expected that 
the program qualifies for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.  
 
The overall market size of ACLF is estimated to be almost $4 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.7 
 
– 
NTZ Phase 1 outcome in ACLF: May 2023 
GENFIT is developing a second program in ACLF in which it is evaluating NTZ. Two Phase 1 studies were completed in the fourth 
quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, and are expected to provide preliminary insight into NTZ pharmacokinetics and 
safety in the setting of hepatic impairment or renal impairment. Outcome of both the hepatic impairment study and the renal 
impairment study will be announced in May 2023. A Phase 2a proof of concept study in patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 is 
currently under discussion with the FDA, and study initiation is targeted for the second half of 2023.  
 
– 
1st patient screening in a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): targeted towards the 
end of 2Q23   
A Phase 1b/2a trial will evaluate GNS561 in patients with advanced KRAS mutated CCA. In the Phase 1b, patients will be enrolled 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with a MEK inhibitor, and to identify the 
recommended doses of the combination to be administered in the Phase 2a study. GENFIT targets to screen the first patient

obtained from the FDA for GNS561, it is expected that the program qualifies for some of the expedited regulatory pathways 
provided by health authorities.  
 
The overall market size of CCA is estimated to be more than $3 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 
2030.8 
 
Preclinical programs 
 
In addition to clinical programs, GENFIT is also  pursuing the development of two preclinical programs: 
  
– 
VS-01-HAC is a potential first-line lifesaving treatment for acute hyperammonemic crisis associated with Inborn Errors 
of Metabolism  in Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD)  and Organic Acidemias (OA). Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling 
nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2024. 
– 
VS-02-HE is developed in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), which is one of the major complications of advanced liver 
disease and portal hypertension. As many as 45% of patients with cirrhosis will experience at least one episode of HE. 
VS-02-HE is a urease inhibitor, and a hydroxamic acid derivative, designed to inhibit ureases by binding to nickel atoms 
in their active site. IND enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2025. 
 
Although these are early-stage programs, they represent a significant potential due to the high unmet medical need. Market size 
for severe hepatic encephalopathy (HE) alone is estimated to be $3 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 
2030.9 For UCD and OA, estimations for 2030 go as high as $1.1 billion in the US and in the five main European countries.10

Revenues and other incomes 
 
Revenue and other operating income for 2022 amounted to €26.6 million compared to €85.6 million for 2021.  
 
In 2022, our revenue totaled €20.2 million and came from three streams related to Ipsen: 
 
• 
In December 2021, we received a €120m non-refundable upfront payment from Ipsen as part of our Collaboration and 
Licencing agreement. €80m was recognized as revenue in 2021, and €40m was booked as deferred revenue and is 
gradually recognized as revenue in subsequent periods following the progress of the ELATIVE® double-blind study. As 
such, of that initial €40m in the deferred revenue balance, €15.9m was recognized as revenue in 2022. 
• 
€3.3 million was recognized as revenue in 2022 in accordance with the Inventory Purchase Agreement signed with 
Ipsen, pursuant to which Ipsen purchased inventory of elafibranor active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product  
during the second half of 2022, with the prospect of transferring the conduct of the ELATIVE® study to Ipsen. 
• 
€1.0 million in revenue was generated from the services rendered by GENFIT to Ipsen in accordance with the Transition 
Services Agreement signed in 2022, which essentially outlines the scope of services to facilitate the transition of some 
activities related to the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC. 
 
In 2022, other operating income totaled €6.4 million. This included mainly the research tax credit (known as Crédit d’Impôt 
Recherche or CIR) granted by the French tax authorities, which amounted to €6.0m. This is up from €5.3 million for 2021. This 
is due to an increase in our research activities in 2022. 
 
Operating results and expenses

Operating expenses for 2022 amounted to €53.9 million, compared to €53.8 million for 2021. This is comprised of research and 
development expenses, general and administrative expenses, marketing and market access expenses, reorganization and 
restructuring expenses,  and other operating expenses.  
 
The slight increase is due to multiple factors: 
 
• 
The increase in research and development costs of €0.6 million, explained by the increase in costs related to new 
programs and product candidates, in particular NTZ, VS-01 and GNS561, offset by the sharp reduction in study costs 
related to RESOLVE-IT®, 
• 
The increase in general and administrative expenses of €0.2 million, explained by the increase in costs related to liability 
insurance, the increase in costs related to consulting fees, and other charges in the normal course of business, 
• 
The decrease in marketing and market access expenses of €0.5 million, mainly explained by the decrease in marketing 
activity in the United States and France, 
• 
The decrease in reorganization and restructuring charges of €0.1 million (effectively null in 2022), and the decrease of 
other operating expenses of €0.1 million. 
 
In 2022, GENFIT generated a consolidated operating loss of €27.3 million, compared to an operating income of €31.8 million in 
2021. 
 
Financial results 
 
2022 resulted in a financial income of €3.5 million compared to a financial income of €37.7 million in 2021. 
 
In 2022, financial income is due to net foreign exchange gains of €7.1 million, interest income of €0.7 million, offset by interest 
expense of €4.3 million.  
 
In 2021, financial income was due to net foreign exchange gains of €6.7 million, interest income of €0.3 million, offset by interest 
expense of €4.9 million. In addition, the company recorded a one time gain of 35.6 million corresponding to a repurchase bonus 
following the renegotiation of the OCEANEs in January 2021.  
 
The foreign exchange result on cash and cash equivalents was a net gain of €7.1 million in 2022, compared to €6.7 million in 
2021. This is notably due to the difference in currency exchange recognized on cash and other current financial assets in US 
dollars, as GENFIT has decided to keep some of its cash in US dollars. These cash and other current financial assets in US dollars 
are to be used to pay directly expenses in US dollars (natural currency hedge).  
 
Cash position 
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets amounted to €140.6 million 
compared with €258.8 million as of December 31, 2021.

This is mainly the result of the following, in addition to normal business activity:  
• 
The payment of €24.0 million in January 2022 representing the VAT collected on the initial upfront payment received 
from Ipsen in December 2021,  
• 
The disbursement of employee participation in the profits of GENFIT SA in May 2022 for a total of €0.6 million for the 
financial year 2021, and  
• 
The acquisition of Versantis AG totaling €41.5m net of cash acquired.

ABOUT GENFIT 
GENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and severe 
liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. GENFIT is a pioneer in liver disease research and 
development with a rich history and strong scientific heritage spanning more than two decades. Thanks to its 
expertise in bringing early-stage assets with high potential to late development and pre-commercialization stages, 
today GENFIT boasts a growing and diversified pipeline of innovative therapeutic and diagnostic solutions. 
 
Its R&D pipeline covers six therapeutic areas via six programs which explore the potential of differentiated 
mechanisms of action, across a variety of development stages (pre-clinical, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3). These diseases 
are acute on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), urea cycle disorder 
(UCD), organic acidemia disorder (OAD) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Beyond therapeutics, GENFIT’s pipeline 
also includes a diagnostic franchise focused on NASH and ACLF. 
 
GENFIT has facilities in Lille and Paris (France), Zurich (Switzerland) and Cambridge, MA (USA). GENFIT is a publicly 
traded company listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and on compartment B of Euronext’s regulated market in 
Paris (Nasdaq and Euronext: GNFT). In 2021, IPSEN became one of GENFIT’s largest shareholders and holds 8% of 
the company’s share capital. www.genfit.com
