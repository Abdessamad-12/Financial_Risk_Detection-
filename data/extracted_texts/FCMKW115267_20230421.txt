Evry, 21 April 2023:  
 
The first phase of the balloting process, conducted within ASTM D02.J Subcommittee, resulted in 
the following: 
- The required quorum was reached with 64.98% of votes cast among the 418 expert members in 
the aeronautical field.  
- The rate of so-called "affirmative" votes is 98.98%, with only one "negative" vote recorded. 
In accordance with the ASTM regulations, the Company is now entering the interaction phase with 
those who abstained with a comment or who voted negatively, and will provide them with 
additional information if necessary. 
As a reminder, ASTM is in charge of the certification of all sustainable aviation fuels according to 
the ASTM D7566 standard which describes the fuel specification requirements and the maximum 
blending percentage with conventional fuels. This is a technical validation by the entire 
aeronautical community based on the analysis of detailed studies that required several years of 
work to ensure safe use in airliners worldwide.
