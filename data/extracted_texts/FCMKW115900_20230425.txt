Sales per activity 
Second quarter 2022-2023 
 
EXEL Industries posted sales of €297.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022-2023, 
up 20.4%. Growth at constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates was 
18.8%. Sustained demand in our various end-markets has generally enabled the Group 
to drive up prices in order to make up for inflation in direct costs.  
Given that the Italian company G.F. was acquired on February 15, 2022, the second quarter 
scope effect was limited to €3.8 million. 
 
 
• 
AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING UP 21.0% 
After peaking in spring 2022, accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine, the prices of some 
agricultural commodities including wheat and rapeseed fell slightly but stayed well above 
pre-COVID levels. As a result, demand remained strong in all regions, enabling the Group 
to maintain a well-stocked order book.  
In addition, sales volumes in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year were particularly 
affected by major supply chain disruptions. Disruptions continue to curb sales volumes for 
some brands, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2022. On the other hand, the price increases 
applied in response to strong inflation also drove sales growth during the quarter.  
 
• 
SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS UP 59.4% 
Sugar prices are experiencing an exceptional but recent surge. Nevertheless, sales 
improved driven by the market launch of the new Terra Dos 5 sugar beet harvester and 
strong demand in Eastern Europe.  
 
• 
LEISURE UP 26.7% 
The Garden business posted strong growth in the Group’s three main operating regions 
(United Kingdom, France and Italy) fueled by favorable comparison with Q2 2022, a 
particularly challenging period impacted by IT migration and a sluggish market. Volumes 
are reverting to pre-COVID levels. 
 
• 
INDUSTRY UP 2.8% 
In the Industrial Spraying business, billings continued to grow at the same pace as in the 
previous quarter, driven by strong momentum in the Asian market. Technical hoses 
continue to suffer from a decline in volumes observed since the fourth quarter of 2022 
which was however offset by higher prices.

Outlook 
 
• 
AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING 
o 
Order books remain well-stocked despite the relative decline in agricultural 
product prices. 
o 
The Group continues to adjust its selling prices in response to rising purchase 
costs.  
o 
Sales of the TRAXX autonomous high-clearance tractor and 3S Spot Spray 
Sensor® high-precision field spraying solution will be spread over the coming 
trimesters. These two major innovations are the result of work started three 
years ago by EXXACT Robotics, our pooled research center dedicated to 
agricultural equipment.  
o 
Business continues to grow in compliance with international regulations in 
Russia, with strict control of customer receipts.  
 
• 
SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS  
o 
The continued rise in sugar and beet prices is expected to drive sales of new 
machines in 2022-2023, provided that the shrinkage in surface area is halted. 
 
• 
LEISURE  
o 
Order intake during the second quarter augurs well for the rest of the year. 
Provided weather conditions remain favorable, business is expected to return 
to volumes comparable to the pre-COVID period. 
 
• 
INDUSTRY  
o 
Regional trends are expected to remain the same in the three main markets 
marked by stabilization in Europe and sustained growth in Asia and North 
America. 
 
 
 
Yves Belegaud, Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group, said: 
“The Group confirmed the excellent first quarter start to the year 
driven by the agricultural equipment core business and strict 
discipline in adjusting selling prices. However, inflation and 
macro-economic uncertainty prompt us to remain vigilant in 
controlling our costs and working capital requirements. EXEL 
Industries is pursuing the policy of strong and sustainable 
innovation that is so highly valued by our demanding users.”
