Paris – April 20, 2023. GTT, the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport 
and store liquefied gases, today announces its revenues for the first quarter of the 2023 financial year. 
Commenting on the results, Philippe Berterottière, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GTT, 
said: “With 25 orders for LNG carriers and one floating liquefied natural gas unit order booked in the first 
quarter of 2023, commercial performance in our core business remains strong in the wake of an exceptional 
2022. Demand for LNG remains particularly strong, as evidenced by the two final investment decisions for 
new liquefaction plants made in the first quarter, which will generate additional needs for LNG carrier over 
the coming years. 
 
GTT is pursuing its constant R&D and innovation efforts with the ambition of being a major technological 
player in the decarbonisation of maritime transport. As such, we obtained several new approvals during the 
first quarter, notably in the field of alternative fuels.  
 
Regarding our CSR strategy, GTT joined the United Nations Global Compact at the beginning of March, 
thereby demonstrating our commitment to a sustainable and responsible economy. 
 
From a financial standpoint, revenues for the first quarter of 2023 show a strong increase of 17.2% compared 
to the first quarter of 2022. Activity will pick up notably in the second half of 2023, benefitting of the growing 
number of ships under construction. In this context, the Group confirms its 2023 targets”.   
 
 
 
Group business activity in Q1 2023 
 
- Continued momentum in LNG carrier orders 
Following a record year in 2022 in terms of orders, GTT booked 25 orders for LNG carriers in the first 
quarter of 2023. Their delivery is scheduled between the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth quarter of 
2027.  
 
GTT also received an order for an FLNG unit, which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2027.

- Digital: signing of new contracts and launch of a new brand  
On January 16, 2023, Ascenz was selected by a major Mexican ship-owner to equip a tanker with its 
Electronic Fuel Monitoring System (EFMS). 
 
In March 2023, Marorka signed a key contract with a major European maritime transport company to install 
automatic data collection systems and intelligent software to manage and optimise energy and 
environmental performance on 30 container ships in 2023, with an option for a further 30 in 2024. In 
addition, GTT has been chosen by two major European LNG ship-owners to equip three vessels with its 
predictive maintenance solution, the “Sloshing Virtual Sensor”. 
 
Finally, GTT announced the creation of a new brand, Ascenz Marorka2, with the mission of providing ship-
owners and charterers with the most advanced, innovative and reliable solutions. 
 
- Further development of Elogen 
In February 2023, Elogen signed a flagship contract with Crosswind, a joint venture between Shell and 
Eneco, as part of an offshore wind farm project for the design and manufacture of a 2.5 MW electrolyser3. 
 
In addition, Elogen is continuing its R&D work with the aim of improving the competitiveness and energy 
efficiency of its solutions. 
 
- Innovation: Development of new technologies – GTT once again the leader in number of patents 
filed 
 
For the fourth year in a row, GTT came first in the INPI ranking of ETIs in terms of number of patents filed 
in 2022. This ranking underlines GTT’s strong innovation dynamic.  
 
Early in the first quarter of 2023, GTT announced that it had received approval in principle from Lloyd’s 
Register for a maintenance optimisation solution for LNG membrane tanks, allowing ship-owners and 
charterers to enhance operational flexibility and achieve substantial savings.  
 
The Group also obtained a €4.66 million subsidy from Bpifrance for the design of an onboard CO2 capture 
system for vessels and the development of intelligent operational performance solutions by OSE 
Engineering4 (GTT Group) as part of the MerVent project. 
 
Finally, OSE Engineering announced its participation in the HyMot5 project, supported by ADEME as part 
of the Programme d’investissements d’avenir (PIA), which aims to intensify research on the development 
of a hydrogen engine for lightweight utility vehicles.  
 
More recently, GTT received 4 approvals in principle from the Japanese classification society ClassNK for 
its latest alternative fuel development projects, namely: 
- 
a 12,500 m3 dual-fuel VLCC6, equipped with the GTT Mark III Flex system;

noted that the number of LNG carriers under construction will increase significantly from the 
second quarter of 2023, thus generating additional revenue notably in the second half of 
2023. Royalties from FSUs amounted to €1.2 million, down 65.6%, the first FSU having been 
delivered during the quarter, and those from onshore tanks to €1.1 million (+44.4%).

KFTC 
 
The Group recalls that by its decision of April 13, 2023, the Supreme Court of Korea rejected the appeal filed 
by GTT in December 2022 against the decision of the Seoul High Court, confirming the Company's obligation 
to separate, in all or part of it, the technical assistance from the technology license agreement if requested 
by the Korean shipyards. 
 
The Company considers that technical assistance and engineering services are essential to the safety and 
performance of its solutions. 
 
2023 outlook confirmed 
 
The Group estimates that activity will pick up notably in the second half of 2023, benefiting from the growing 
number of ships under construction. 
In this context and in the absence of any significant order delays or cancellations, GTT confirms its targets 
for the 2023 financial year, namely:   
- 
2023 consolidated revenues of between 385 million euros and 430 million euros, 
- 
2023 consolidated EBITDA of between 190 million euros and 235 million euros, 
- 
the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 financial year corresponding to a minimum payout ratio of 
80% of consolidated net income15.
