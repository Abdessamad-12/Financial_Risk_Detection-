LUMIBIRD RECEIVES MARKETING APPROVAL IN CHINA FOR ITS 
VITRA 2 PHOTOCOAGULATOR 
 
The LUMIBIRD Group (FR0000038242 - LBIRD), the European leader for laser 
technologies, announced today that its medical division, Lumibird Medical, has 
received marketing approval in China for its Vitra 2 photo-coagulation laser from the 
Chinese Health Authority (NMPA). 
This significant product in the Lumibird Medical group's range of lasers for the treatment of retinal 
pathologies (AMD, diabetic retinopathy) reinforces Lumibird's position on the Chinese market with 
the support of its distribution partner Gaush. 
For Jean-Marc Gendre, CEO of Lumibird Medical, "This registration, which comes after a long period of 
examination, will have an impact on sales of Vitra 2 in China as of the second quarter. It paves the way for 
further market approvals in China for key products in the range. For the year 2023, the launch of the Vitra 2 
alone should enable us to increase our sales by 25%, compared to a revenue 
8 million in China in 2022.  
 
After a contracted period since 2021 on the Chinese market (Covid effect, administrative delays...) 
Lumibird Medical intends to continue the implementation of sales of its products with hospitals in 
China with growth prospects on all its ranges. 
 
 
Next date: Q1 2023 revenues on April 24, 2023 after close of trading
