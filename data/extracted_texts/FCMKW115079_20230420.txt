for renewable hydrogen and the accreditation for a new 'anti-waste' label. 
Looking ahead, and considering evolving macroeconomic uncertainties impacting our clients, we confirm our 
outlook for 2023.”

Revenue in the first quarter of 2023 amounted to EUR 1,404.5 million, an 8.9% increase compared with 
Q1 2022. Organic growth was 8.5%, led by sustained strong momentum for Sustainability and energy 
transition across all businesses. 
Half of the portfolio (Agri-Food & Commodities and Buildings & Infrastructure) was up 8.4% organically on 
average, benefiting from strong trends for both Opex and Capex activities. More than a third of the portfolio 
(Certification, Industry and Marine & Offshore) delivered a 12.5% average organic revenue growth led by 
new energies and decarbonization trends. Less than a sixth of the portfolio (Consumer Products Services) 
declined 3.5% organically, impacted by high inventory levels and reduced product launches. 
By geography, activities in Americas were strong (28% of revenue; up 13.9% organically), led by a 7.8% 
increase in the US (Buildings & Infrastructure driven) and by a 26.5% increase in Latin America (led by 
Brazil and Chile notably). Europe (35% of revenue; up 6.7% organically) was primarily led by high activity 
levels in Southern Europe and in the Netherlands. In Asia Pacific (28% of revenue; up 4.3% organically), 
extremely robust growth was achieved in Australia as well as in South-East Asian countries while China 
returned to growth in the quarter. Finally, activity was also strong in Africa and the Middle East (9% of 
revenue, up 14.0% organically) primarily driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the 
Middle East. 
The scope effect was a positive 1.5%, reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters. 
Currency fluctuations had a slight negative impact of 1.1%, mainly due to the depreciation of some 
emerging countries’ currencies against the euro. 
 
SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION 
At the end of March 2023, the Group's adjusted net financial debt slightly increased compared with the 
level at December 31, 2022. The Group had EUR 1.6 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and 
EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the 
bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. 
 
2023 OUTLOOK CONFIRMED 
Based on a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability, and 
taking into account the current macro uncertainties, Bureau Veritas expects for the full year 2023 to deliver: 
• Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; 
• A stable adjusted operating margin;

The Marine & Offshore business delivered a strong 13.5% organic revenue increase in the first quarter of 
2023 with the following trends: 
• A mid-single digit increase in New Construction (39% of divisional revenue), supported by a strong 
orderbook made of various types and sizes of vessels; 
• Core In-service activity (47% of divisional revenue) posted a solid double-digit growth, benefiting 
from a Covid-19 delayed occasional surveys and positive pricing. At March end, the fleet classified 
by Bureau Veritas comprised of 11,524 ships, representing 144.8 million of Gross Register Tonnage 
(GRT); 
• Services (14% of divisional revenue, including Offshore) recorded a mid-single-digit growth, 
benefiting from the extension of non-classification services. 
New orders totaled 2.3 million gross tons at the end of March 2023 (similar to the prior year period) in a 
shipping market down in the first quarter. This brings the order book to 21.2 million gross tons at the end 
of the quarter, up 5.5% compared to December 2022. It remains highly diversified and composed of LNG 
fueled ships, container ships and specialized vessels. 
Over Q1 2023, the Marine & Offshore division pursued its efforts to leverage digitalization following the 
Group’s partnership with the global maritime software provider NAPA that enables prescriptive rule checks 
and calculations utilizing 3D model tools. In early 2023, Damen Engineering announced the completion of 
their first vessel design to be entirely created, reviewed and class-approved by Bureau Veritas using 3D 
models. 
 
Sustainability achievements 
The division continued to benefit from its market leader positioning on alternative fuels, mainly LNG and 
methanol dual propulsion over the course of the first quarter.  
Bureau Veritas has issued an Approval in Principle (AIP) to Viridis Bulk Carriers, supporting a new 
standard for zero carbon short sea bulk logistics by utilizing ammonia as fuel. This is a major milestone, 
enabling the uptake of ammonia as fuel to decarbonize the maritime industry. 
In March 2023, the Group announced that it will provide full plan approval and design support to class two 
diesel-electric propulsion, double hull, double end ferries for operation in Hong Kong. One of the ferries 
will be built with hybrid diesel-electric propulsion and will be zero emission when sailing within pier 
boundaries, while both will be equipped with battery and solar power technology.

The Agri-Food & Commodities business achieved organic revenue growth of 7.7% in the first quarter of 
2023, with positive trends for all activities.  
The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P, 30% of divisional revenue) recorded mid-single-digit organic 
growth. The O&P Trade market reported a steady growth, driven by higher volumes and pricing. A very good 
performance was delivered in Europe, which benefited from the trade flow route changes triggered by the 
war in Ukraine. Strong activity was achieved for non-trade related services such as Verifuel bunker quantity 
services and sustainability-driven solutions which continued to expand across O&P.  
 
 
5 / 11 
The Metals & Minerals segment (M&M, 33% of divisional revenue) achieved mid-single-digit organic growth 
overall. The Upstream business (nearly two-thirds of M&M) showed solid growth (up 3.4% organically).  
The exploration activity slowed down as a result of tightening financial conditions for junior explorers while 
large mining companies continued to be active. In mining related testing, the activity continued to be driven 
by a mix of gold, energy transition metals and bulk minerals. The Group’s on-site labs business expanded 
further in Q1 with key wins in Latin America notably. Trade activities recorded double digit organic revenue 
growth (up 12.1% organically), fueled by all the main commodities (copper, coal and non-ferrous metals), 
with strong trade volumes in Asia, the Middle East and Southern Africa as well as by pricing initiatives. The 
demand continues to be driven by the mega-trends of urbanization, electrification/energy transition. 
Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) grew mid-single digit on an organic basis, with strong performance 
in Agricultural trade activities and Food inspection. The agricultural inspection activities grew strongly, 
across the board, benefiting particularly from solid trends in Asia and in the Middle East. The Food 
business saw improving trends, mainly driven by the Asia Pacific region and the Middle East. Southeast 
Asian countries benefited from a government contract on food safety. In the Group’s largest Australian 
hub, the diversification strategy contributed to growth. 
Government services (15% of divisional revenue) delivered a double-digit organic growth in the quarter 
across most geographies. It benefited from the ramp-up of both several VOC (Verification of Conformity) 
contracts (Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Iraq) and Single Window contracts in Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC), Togo and Armenia. In addition, strong activity level on existing contracts fueled the growth in DRC.  
Sustainability achievements  
In the first quarter of 2023, Bureau Veritas was awarded a Food Safety and Quality Control contract in the 
Middle East to support regional farmers and producers to comply with the standards and regulations 
demand of a new sustainable city.

Industry was amongst the best performing business within the Group’s portfolio in the first quarter of 2023 
with an organic growth of 12.5%, with growth in all segments. 
By geography, most regions delivered strong growth in the quarter, with Latin America leading the way 
alongside Australia, North America and Europe.  
By market, Power & Utilities (15% of divisional revenue) remained a key growth driver of the portfolio 
with double digit organic performance achieved in the first quarter for both Opex and Capex activities. In 
Latin America (Chile and Argentina notably), the activity was strongly supported by the ramp-up of contract 
wins with various Power Distribution clients (Opex utility field operation services), volume increases on 
existing contracts and price renegotiation. In Europe, the nuclear power generation segment grandly 
contributed to the growth in both France and the UK.  
Renewable Power Generation activities (solar, wind, hydrogen) continued to accelerate with high double-
digit organic performance delivered across most geographies. This was notably the case in the US, with 
a very dynamic activity from Bureau Veritas’ Bradley Construction Management (solar energy construction 
projects), benefiting from easing supply chain restrictions and early opportunities from the Inflation 
Reduction Act investment expectations. Opportunities around hydrogen, carbon capture and storage 
projects are promising. 
In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue), double digit organic revenue growth was achieved in the quarter. 
Two-thirds of the business related to Opex services increased 14.2% as they continue to benefit from the 
conversion of a solid sales pipeline and a healthy backlog. Capex-related activities, including Procurement 
Services, grew high single digit organically, essentially attributable to the startup of new projects.

Sustainability achievements 
In the first quarter of 2023, the Group signed Memorandum of Understanding with KPMG in Singapore, 
Maybank and the National University of Singapore to co-develop plug-and-play decarbonization solutions 
in Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The aim is to assist companies from the energy, transport and real 
estate sectors to assess and mitigate the impact of climate change on their businesses.

The Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved strong organic growth of 9.0% in the first quarter, 
primarily fueled by the Americas and by the Middle East.  
Double-digit organic revenue growth was delivered in Construction-related activities (55% of divisional 
revenue) and mid-single-digit growth in Buildings In-service activities (45% of divisional revenue). 
The Group delivered a significant step up in organic growth in the Americas (27% of divisional revenue) 
fueled by most countries. Bureau Veritas US operations recorded high single digit organic revenue growth 
benefiting from its diversified portfolio of activities (data center commissioning services, project 
management assistance and transactional activity for Opex-related services, etc…). A particularly strong 
momentum was achieved in the technical control and station product conformity services for Electric 
Vehicle Charging Stations. In Latin America, the Group delivered a very strong growth fueled by the ramp-
up of large Capex contracts for project management assistance signed in the second half of 2022.  
Growth in Europe (50% of divisional revenue) was robust overall, benefiting from a solid mix of businesses 
in both construction and buildings in-service activity. Double digit growth was delivered in the UK, Spain 
and Italy. In France, the growth was primarily driven by the In-service activity (around three quarters of 
the French business) as it benefited from positive pricing and from the dynamic performance of the Group 
solutions for energy related services (technical assistance, consulting services). The Capex-related work 
delivered growth led by technical control and its higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works 
against residential buildings.  
The Asia pacific region (19% of divisional revenue) recorded a 7.9% organic revenue increase led by South-
Eastern Asian countries. In China, the business remained subdued. The sales pipeline is on the upward 
trend. The activity performed strongly in India (up 29% organically). 
Lastly, in the Middle East & Africa region (4% of divisional revenue), the Group continued to deliver very high 
growth primarily led by Saudi Arabia, and by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), benefiting from the 
development of numerous projects. In Saudi Arabia, the Group remained strongly engaged in delivering 
QA/QC Services for the NEOM project, a smart city that will be powered by renewable energy and become 
a center for biotechnology, media and entertainment. 
Sustainability achievements 
The Group has developed an Audit Framework and Gap Analysis service for the Climate Neutral Data 
Centre Pact (CNDCP) in collaboration with the European Data Center Association (EUDCA) and Cloud 
Infrastructure Service Provider in Europe (CISPE). The framework will enable to assess and verify the 
compliance of data centers with the Pact’s Self-Regulatory Initiative (SRI), ensuring their sustainability 
and efficiency. Bureau Veritas designed this framework to help its data center owner and/or operator 
clients implement a compliance strategy aligned with various regulations: the EU Taxonomy, the EU 
Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

The Certification business achieved a strong organic growth of 11.2% in the first quarter of 2023. The 
growth was supported by both volume and robust pricing across most geographies and schemes.  
All geographies grew organically. The Americas and Asia Pacific performed above the divisional average, 
led by a solid commercial development and strong traction for Sustainability-driven services. Very high 
growth was recorded in countries where the offering has been expanded with new schemes (with the shift 
from traditional QHSE schemes towards new services). This was illustrated by Brazil (second party 
audits), Australia, Vietnam and China (Sustainability driven). 
Within the Group’s portfolio, double-digit growth was recorded for both QHSE schemes (back to a normal 
year post recertification) and Supply Chain & Sustainability while Food certification (led by Food 
Safety) grew high single-digit organically. In Australia, the Group was awarded a large outsourcing 
contract with the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission to undertake audits of aged care facilities 
against the Aged Care Quality Standards.  
The search for more brand protection, data transparency, and social responsibility commitments all along 
the supply chain continued to support the demand for Bureau Veritas services. In Q1, the growth of its 
Sustainability services remained strong (up 17.8%). It reflected a high demand for verification of 
Greenhouse gas emissions and supply chain audits on ESG topics.   
Supported by regulatory changes, the Group’s portfolio diversification continued in the quarter and was a 
growth enhancer. The momentum was particularly strong on solutions dedicated to companies around 
Anti-bribery, IT Service Management Information Security and Business Continuity. In particular, the 
cybersecurity offering posted a 33.5% organic revenue growth in Q1, led by an extremely robust 
commercial development and by rising demand for more control on security systems. 
Sustainability achievements 
In the first quarter of 2023, Bureau Veritas granted the first French “anti-food waste” label to a Carrefour 
supermarket, following a successful audit of the store and head office. Valid for a period of three years, it 
recognizes best practices in three fields: procurement and purchasing of food merchandise from suppliers, 
marketing of food items in stores, and management and donation of unsold items. The Group has also 
been accredited by UKAS, the National Accreditation Body for the United Kingdom, to deliver ISO 19443 
certificates to control quality throughout the external service chain of the nuclear industry. 
Bureau Veritas also announced the launch of a certification scheme dedicated to renewable hydrogen. 
This certification aims to support the industry to ensure that hydrogen is produced under safe and 
sustainable practices, and from renewable energy sources.  
The Group was also awarded a large contract from an Oil & Gas company to ensure Safety, Health and 
compliance environmental audits on more than 30 customer sites in seven states all around Brazil.

The Consumer Products Services division posted a (3.5)% organic revenue performance over the first 
quarter of 2023, with varying geographical and service trends.  
Asia is the region most impacted by the global economic slowdown, especially China, Korea and 
Southeastern countries, while Americas (especially Latin America) and the Middle East continue to benefit 
from the diversification strategy implemented over the last years and from the structural near-shoring 
market trends.

Softlines, Hardlines & Toys (48% of divisional revenue) saw mid-single digit organic decrease in the first 
quarter of 2023, due to the lower volumes and the resulting high inventory levels, even though the activity 
in China started to improve somewhat after the easing of Covid restrictions.  
Health, Beauty & Household (8% of divisional revenue) delivered solid double-digit organic growth in 
Q1.  This promising performance is complemented by the successful ramp-up of Advanced Testing 
Laboratory (ATL) and Galbraith Laboratories Inc. which were both acquired last year in the US. These 
help strengthen Bureau Veritas’ position in this growing sector.  
Inspection and Audit services (12% of divisional revenue) maintained their good, high-single digit 
organic growth momentum revolving around CSR audits over the course of the first quarter of 2023, while 
Technology (32%) was affected by the global decrease in demand for electrical and wireless equipment 
as well as the resulting temporary reduction in new product launches. The New Mobility sub-segment is 
still posting a solid double-digit growth on the back of good traction on testing on electric vehicle engines, 
dashboards or charging stations. 
The Group continued to pursue its geographical diversification strategy to take advantage of the structural 
sourcing shifts currently unfolding in South and Southeast Asia. In this respect, Bureau Veritas recently 
opened a new lab in Hanoi which will be fully dedicated to connectivity and wireless testing.

APPENDIX 2: DEFINITION OF ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND 
RECONCILIATION WITH IFRS 
The management process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance 
indicators, as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s 
budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide 
additional useful information to financial statement users, enabling them to better understand the Group’s 
performance, especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the 
testing, inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial 
community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant 
indicators and the resulting changes. 
GROWTH 
Total revenue growth  
The total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous 
year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:  
• organic growth; 
• impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);  
• impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect). 
Organic growth 
The Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth, which it considers to be more 
representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.  
The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like, or organic 
growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the 
impact of currency fluctuations, which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control, as well as scope effects, 
which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic 
growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally. 
Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more 
comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends, 
excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned 
suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions, for example) and changes in exchange 
rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility, which can mask underlying trends. 
The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses 
provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses, and 
enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry. 
 
 
11 / 11 
Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth, presented at Group level and for 
each business, based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods: 
• constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of 
consolidation over a 12-month period; 
• constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous 
year. 
Scope effect  
To establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods, the impact of changes in the scope of 
consolidation is determined:  
• for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue 
generated by the acquired businesses in the current year; 
• for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year 
revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were 
not consolidated; 
• for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the 
previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in 
the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group; 
• for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the 
previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior 
to their disposal/divestment. 
Currency effect  
The currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the 
previous year.
